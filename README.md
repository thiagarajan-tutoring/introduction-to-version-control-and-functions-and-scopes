# Version Control, Functions, and Scopes

In this assignment, we'll briefly introduce version control and why it's useful. Additionally, we'll look at functions in Python, and global and local scopes for variables in Python.

## Objectives
* Become familiar with basic version control commands in Git
* Learn about how to define and use functions, including recursive functions 
* Learn about how variables can be scoped globally and locally, and why each case might be useful in the context of user-defined functions
